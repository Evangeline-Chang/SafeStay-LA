729317,22215734,321638015,2018-09-10,28367727,Dee,"The room is simply lovely! As nice, even more so, than the pics indicate. It is wonderfully clean and well designed. The attention to detail was greatly appreciated. Just two things to note: the room was on the humid side so the sliding door had to be open or the air conditioning had to be on at all times. This may be a temporary issue since it seemed like the carpet was recently shampooed. And based on other reviews, I thought there would be a designated parking spot available. This was not the case. Fortunately, I arrived early enough to get a space on the street in front of the house. Not sure how driveway spaces are decided, if at all, but, if important, you may want to confirm. An earlier review mentioned the noise level. Hearing occasional movement in adjacent units was not a problem for me. It happens in multi-unit buildings not made of concrete. All was still and quiet before I was ready to retire for the night. All of that said...The bed was awesome! The check-in process was simple. The room was private and safe. And the complementary beverages were delightful. Clearly the host put a lot of thought into creating this space. Well done!",2018.0

The bedroom and bathroom were very modern and the space was welcoming. The only complaint was the walls are a bit thin and it was noisy/difficult going to sleep with children (my husband and I had to get to bed early to catch a flight to the Philippines in the morning) and we were also woken up during the night from other guests above our unit. Granted we are light sleepers. Isaac was responsive with our texts inquiring about lowering the noise. Still a pleasant place if you want to something clean and close to LAX,2018.0

Again, no instructions left.<br/>Beware, the host makes no mention of street sweeping on Wednesday mornings and we received a ticket. We arrived late at night and saw no signs stating otherwise.

730472,22215734,669397904,2020-09-29,196632095,Theresa,"First & foremost, I want to start by saying that this place is beautiful and the positive reviews is what initially lured me into booking, but there were a few issues that occurred. <br/>To start, I was laying down watching tv around 11 pm and hear someone approach the door. As they approached the door, they moved the knob (as if they were trying to come in) and walked away as soon as they heard me get up. Once I get up to try and see who it was, they were gone but out of curiosity, I check to see if the sliding door (leading to the porch) was locked— it wasn’t! I instantly lock it and of course my mind starts wondering if anyone was inside the place while I was gone throughout the day, or if anyone was going to come in while I was sleeping (if I didn’t check the sliding door and it was left unlocked). However, I didn’t let this incident alter my decision to stay the night and didn’t alert the host. <br/>Next morning comes around and around 11am, the cleaning lady comes to knock on the door to see if I’ve checked out yet. However, she didn’t need to come just yet cause not only is checkout at noon; there is a button you push next to the front door to alert the cleaning lady to come once you leave. <br/>Approximately 30 minutes pass by (still isn’t check out time), and the same lady keys the code into the door and walks into the place WHILE I AM NAKED, preparing to take a quick shower prior to leaving. She did not knock at all and again, CHECK OUT WAS AT NOON! I instantly start yelling cause this is the THIRD TIME in less than 24 hours that someone has come to the door for NO REASON. I immediately alert the host of the situation and he instantly replies, urging to call him on the phone. I call him on the phone once I’m out the shower and after speaking about the situation, there was no resolution. He didn’t offer any form of refund or anything for the consistent inconvenience; only tried to reassure me that if I ever chose to stay there again, these incidences wouldn’t happen. <br/>On that note, though this is a nice place... to the point I wanted to stay an additional night; after the consistent issues, I will not be staying at this location due to the lack of safety, hospitality, and communication.",2020.0

The colors and feel are neutral like a hotel, but the location is quiet and comfortable like a tucked away studio apartment. Parking was easy the night we arrived (on Sunday) and having a ‘staycation’ night in the city here was lovely. The temp had dropped after we took a walk around the neighborhood and being able to turn in the heat when came back was great. In less than 3 minutes, we were all warmed up from the wall mounted appliance. We were also looking for a place that was dog friendly for the sweetest 40ish lb tree walker coonhound we have. She was comfortable too. Curled right up for a night’s sleep below the bed on her doggy blankets. The bathroom was clean, the mattress and bed slept well, the tv is huge and if you’re into catching half a cooking show like we did, you won’t need any other lights on as it lights the entire room. The neighbors were friendly. Walking our dog, we shared courtesy “hello’s” with everyone we passed that night and the next morning. Checkout service was smooth as well. We even had time to dance and sit outside in the mini courtyard before taking off. We had a wonderful experience and would book it again in a heartbeat.",2021.0

Upon entering the room, there was rain water that had leaked in through the main door so I immediately messaged the host about it, especially due to their added rule on keeping the carpet clean. The sliding doors & the restroom were both open/unlocked when we arrived which caused me to feel a bit unsafe. No lotion was available. The room was extremely humid & I sweat through the night as a result. The biggest concern was that at almost 11pm, there was metal clanging & dragging, stomping, & loud talking behind & right above our heads (from where the bed was located).  I had to message the host in order to get him to take action on it. The room is definitely overpriced & needs better insulation.",2023.0

The garden patio and water fountain they have as part of the guest suite is so calming and adds a super peaceful vibe to the place. <br/>Easy check in, Jeff greeted me on arrival and gave me a thorough tour of the place - which was really sweet as most hosts don’t usualy go out of their way. They’ve really thought about everything you could need during your stay here and I loved how well stocked and full of amenities the place was. They even had a hair dryer in the bathroom (rare). Especially appreciated that they lent me their blender since I mentioned I loved blended iced coffee in the mornings. I was cooking during my stay and the kitchen is fully functional. Loved that the place had 2 ac’s as most places in La usually just have one. <br/>I had a car and even though Jeff and Shelly provided a permit for parking on the street they also let me park my car in the driveway. <br/>Very easy to talk to, prompt replies, parcels I had ordered they would sweetly leave at the door for me. they have this beautiful dog Leo who is such a stud. He’s not out much but I love dogs so I would always say hi to him. <br/>You have your own privacy as there are windows with nifty blinds on every window. I liked knowing that Jeff and Shelly were close by and usually left my doors open while cooking in the mornings, familial vibe. Sunshine and birds etc. <br/>Location wise, works perfect whether you want to go to Venice to train, or Santa Monica to chill or be quiet on your own.  I caught a lot of great movies at the Landmark theatre which is walking distance and it’s the best since they have q/a shows with the cast and directors of the movies as well. Close to grocery stores, salons, gas stations everything. <br/>Loved my stay here, thank you Jeff & Shelly♥️",2018.0

My daughter and I were visiting and needed to be close to relatives so the location was ideal. Great local resources/places to eat (and I have a limited diet) and lovely neighborhood. <br/>This space has been SO thoughtfully done. It's modern, clean, a 'smart' casita, all basic and nice amenities provided. Really MORE than basic amenities were provided. These folks went above and beyond. It was such a pleasure! Honestly it felt like a mini, more new version of our own home...peaceful, zen, restful...even though you're in the middle of LA. What I'm trying to say is that we felt AT home there. The temperature control inside, and lovely spot to sit in the garden were clutch! Hummingbirds flew by outside. They have a beautiful space and were prompt, helpful, and there on the spot if needed, though they otherwise completely left us to have our own quiet time. Parking was great, and lots to drive to within 10-15 minutes (like museums)....or walk to.<br/>These are good people. <br/>Tough coming to LA heat and traffic from the Pacific Northwest, but they made our stay wonderful and not too intense. The experience was low impact, no stress. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. I think my daughter gave them 11 out of 10 stars on their erase board, and that's saying a lot!  I'd go on here but suffice it to say I'm only able to give the highest recommendation here, based on our stay. Thank you Jeff and Shelley! ",2018.0

You essentially are getting a penthouse equivalent, but it's more affordable, and it feels like your own home away from home.

The casita will get stuffy if you don't open the windows. The dishwasher works very well. The bathroom is very nice. The TV set up has Youtube TV and is great to use.<br/>The only issue I had is a received a TON of mosquito bites during my stay. Jeff accommodated me by helping me install a mosquito net that I purchased, which helped a lot. I still got bit while hanging around the casita though. The other thing I noticed was that there are a ton of spiders in the unit, which I didn't mind, but might bother some people.<br/>The other thing I will say is Jeff and Shelley are nice people for the most part. But when I was dealing with numerous bites (and it was bad, I had to go see a doctor who suspected fleas or bed bugs, though it turned out to just be mosquitoes) they were extremely defensive and condescending. Their tone completely changed from ""warm host"" to people that only cared about making sure they got paid. They didn't care about my condition at all and didn't speak to me in a friendly manner.<br/>I did need to extend my stay a few days and they accommodated that, which I appreciated. They also worked with me to return a couple items I had left behind.<br/>Overall, would've been an excellent place to stay had it not been for the mosquitoes that found their way inside and the few negative interactions I had with Jeff and Shelley (though most were positive). Because I think reviews should depend on price, and because this property was over $4k/month and I don't think the price reflected that, 3 stars.",2022.0

The location is actually on the main road, so once you are backing from the parking place, you are on a main road with high traffic, so really need to watch out. 2. The apartment only has a 2nd floor, so the minute you open the door, you have to drag the luggage case across long stair steps, which is kind of inconvenient. The place does not have a kitchen and only a coffee machine, so drinking water become a little bit difficult. And also it does not have central ac, so it will take a while for the unit to warm up.",2021.0

But beware, the water for the shower wasn’t hot at all. I actually a bit upset by this, but the owner didn’t charge me for checking out late, so I didn’t wanna complain, but that’s something they need to work on and improve. I would also strongly suggest they fix the jacuzzi, which was advertised, but didn’t work at all. I actually wanted a credit for a future stay or discount or a portion of my money returned for these two issues. I would say, other than this, the apt/condo is very nice and spacious too!! <br/>I did enjoy staying there but the bed could also use an upgrade, the mattress is not that soft and could be replaced!!

Well lit, had the amenities we were looking for. Grant was very proactive with his communications throughout our stay. I can see the entrance check-in being a little tricky but because Grant was so communicative, check in was a breeze. There are a set of stairs to climb so be aware if you’re hauling suitcases (not too steep). <br/>Only thing is that walls aren’t soundproof, we could hear our neighbors with music past 11pm. <br/>Other than that, highly recommend this comfortable and safe spot.",2023.0

The amenities were perfect and both Grant and Tianna were amazing hosts!  Grant even checked on us after our first night to ensure everything was great.  Tianna followed up with me after check-out with some additional travel inquires in such a prompt manner.  Both hosts exuded an exceptional client experience so will definitely be staying with them any time that we are in California (if they have the availability).,2023.0

My husband has respiratory sensitivity so that the scent on the linens either from the laundry detergent or the possible use of an additive triggered an an adverse reaction. Our hosts were very kind and understanding. We left for dinner for 2 plus hours to give our hosts time to drop off freshly laundered set of linens & blankets but we were unable to stay as the scent had permeated the apartment.
