I love to work and yet I love to do nothing. I love my dog Jimmy - I love my family and friends - and most importantly I love good food!

I've done a little bit of traveling but would like to do more. When I travel to other countries I like to stay for at least 2 or 3 months when possible so I can really get the feel of a place.

I believe that pretty much anything is possible in one way or another and I don't like to think in terms of limitation.

I'm a good host because it's important to me that people have as good an experience as possible because that's my natural work ethic - I strive for excellence not perfection. But I will totally stay out of your way - if you don't need me then I'm invisible.  And I like being invisible.

I am a people person and love the outdoors. We love having visitors in our guesthouse! It not only gives them a lovely place of well-being in busy Los Angeles, but it also allows our family to connect with adults and kids from around the world. My profile photo is taken in the Flathead Indian territory  in Northern Montana while photographing my family in the mountains.
 My background is in the visual arts with a long work history in the film business. I love documenting the world around me through photos and video. In recent years, i've spent most of my time raising our twins, gardening and finding breaks for yoga & swimming, shooting promo videos and concert events and helping a group of founding parents start a public Spanish immersion elementary school in the West Adams area of Los Angeles.

Our family loves to travel, cook, swim, hike, eat healthily, and attend the free summer/fall musical outdoor jazz & Latin jazz family picnic concerts in the nearby LAcMA park on Friday and Saturday evenings. For many years we've had an eclectic mix of guests renting our charming guesthouse primarily through word of mouth. In the last four years, we've expanded our network and are SO excited to have met a wonderful new group of guests via  Airbnb. We ve had an AMAZING group of visitors and return guests to whom we are very grateful!!!....and hope to see again and again.

As a host, I pride myself on helping guests in any way I can....whether it be providing an iron/ironing board for a wedding, or special baby gear, referring a special restaurant in the area or across town, giving directions to my favorite semi-private Malibu & Santa Barbara beaches, or helping a family enroll their kids in the nearby museum s NExtGen Sunday free art program....I am here to help...Please ask! 

I speak fluent French and am getting myself and our family up to speed on Spanish. Our small guesthouse library has books on many subjects in English (and some in French & Spanish).
