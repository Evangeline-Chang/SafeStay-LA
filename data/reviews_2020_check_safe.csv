Isaac was very prompt and clear with communication which was awesome! It had everything a hotel room would have, excellent heat/AC, even a hair dryer, and the TV was much bigger than I expected. The mattress was like a memory foam mattress. We weren't in the area for LAX BUT if you need to stay close to the airport it is super convenient. Would stay again!",2020.0

514,22215734.0,669397904.0,2020-09-29,"First & foremost, I want to start by saying that this place is beautiful and the positive reviews is what initially lured me into booking, but there were a few issues that occurred. <br/>To start, I was laying down watching tv around 11 pm and hear someone approach the door. As they approached the door, they moved the knob (as if they were trying to come in) and walked away as soon as they heard me get up. Once I get up to try and see who it was, they were gone but out of curiosity, I check to see if the sliding door (leading to the porch) was locked— it wasn’t! I instantly lock it and of course my mind starts wondering if anyone was inside the place while I was gone throughout the day, or if anyone was going to come in while I was sleeping (if I didn’t check the sliding door and it was left unlocked). However, I didn’t let this incident alter my decision to stay the night and didn’t alert the host. <br/>Next morning comes around and around 11am, the cleaning lady comes to knock on the door to see if I’ve checked out yet. However, she didn’t need to come just yet cause not only is checkout at noon; there is a button you push next to the front door to alert the cleaning lady to come once you leave. <br/>Approximately 30 minutes pass by (still isn’t check out time), and the same lady keys the code into the door and walks into the place WHILE I AM NAKED, preparing to take a quick shower prior to leaving. She did not knock at all and again, CHECK OUT WAS AT NOON! I instantly start yelling cause this is the THIRD TIME in less than 24 hours that someone has come to the door for NO REASON. I immediately alert the host of the situation and he instantly replies, urging to call him on the phone. I call him on the phone once I’m out the shower and after speaking about the situation, there was no resolution. He didn’t offer any form of refund or anything for the consistent inconvenience; only tried to reassure me that if I ever chose to stay there again, these incidences wouldn’t happen. <br/>On that note, though this is a nice place... to the point I wanted to stay an additional night; after the consistent issues, I will not be staying at this location due to the lack of safety, hospitality, and communication.",2020.0

The colors and feel are neutral like a hotel, but the location is quiet and comfortable like a tucked away studio apartment. Parking was easy the night we arrived (on Sunday) and having a ‘staycation’ night in the city here was lovely. The temp had dropped after we took a walk around the neighborhood and being able to turn in the heat when came back was great. In less than 3 minutes, we were all warmed up from the wall mounted appliance. We were also looking for a place that was dog friendly for the sweetest 40ish lb tree walker coonhound we have. She was comfortable too. Curled right up for a night’s sleep below the bed on her doggy blankets. The bathroom was clean, the mattress and bed slept well, the tv is huge and if you’re into catching half a cooking show like we did, you won’t need any other lights on as it lights the entire room. The neighbors were friendly. Walking our dog, we shared courtesy “hello’s” with everyone we passed that night and the next morning. Checkout service was smooth as well. We even had time to dance and sit outside in the mini courtyard before taking off. We had a wonderful experience and would book it again in a heartbeat.",2021.0

Beaches like Venice beach was only 15-20 mins away. Airport is only 10 mins away, and if you rent a car like me at most 10 mins away from drop off locations. If you don’t mind driving a little this is the best location, quiet and clean, in a safe residential neighborhood with plenty of parking. I stayed for 3 nights, it went smoothly. The bed was very comfortable, the host provides a keurig coffee machine for your coffee needs, which was great. There’s an air conditioner if it gets too hot. Only think I wish was the bed was one size bigger since I’m a bigger guy. And if the fridge had more space for any type of bottles.

The gate locked us out & stopped working once we entered so it had to be left propped open. Upon entering the room, there was rain water that had leaked in through the main door so I immediately messaged the host about it, especially due to their added rule on keeping the carpet clean. The sliding doors & the restroom were both open/unlocked when we arrived which caused me to feel a bit unsafe. No lotion was available. The room was extremely humid & I sweat through the night as a result. The biggest concern was that at almost 11pm, there was metal clanging & dragging, stomping, & loud talking behind & right above our heads (from where the bed was located).  I had to message the host in order to get him to take action on it. The room is definitely overpriced & needs better insulation.",2023.0

The casita will get stuffy if you don't open the windows. The dishwasher works very well. The bathroom is very nice. The TV set up has Youtube TV and is great to use.<br/>The only issue I had is a received a TON of mosquito bites during my stay. Jeff accommodated me by helping me install a mosquito net that I purchased, which helped a lot. I still got bit while hanging around the casita though. The other thing I noticed was that there are a ton of spiders in the unit, which I didn't mind, but might bother some people.<br/>The other thing I will say is Jeff and Shelley are nice people for the most part. But when I was dealing with numerous bites (and it was bad, I had to go see a doctor who suspected fleas or bed bugs, though it turned out to just be mosquitoes) they were extremely defensive and condescending. Their tone completely changed from ""warm host"" to people that only cared about making sure they got paid. They didn't care about my condition at all and didn't speak to me in a friendly manner.<br/>I did need to extend my stay a few days and they accommodated that, which I appreciated. They also worked with me to return a couple items I had left behind.<br/>Overall, would've been an excellent place to stay had it not been for the mosquitoes that found their way inside and the few negative interactions I had with Jeff and Shelley (though most were positive).

1199,39471761.0,605483984.0,2020-02-14,"Grant's home is definitely the one you want to stay if you are transiting at Los Angeles Airport. It is just a 5 to 10 minutes drive away and is close to all the car rental companies. This makes things very easy for us as we have a 9am flight to catch. The house is clean and with a huge TV rooted near the ceiling. This makes binge watching on the bed an amazing experience. The toilet facilities is simple awesome! I thought I step into a 6 star hotel with the huge bath tub and 3 basin in total. You have to see it in person to know what I mean. You have a guaranteed parking space house right in front of the garage as well. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would recommend to anyone who wants to stay near LAX!",2020.0

Grant was very responsive and communicated all necessary details promptly and efficiently which was very welcome when coordinating the multiple logistics that transatlantic travel with dogs in the middle of a pandemic demands.  The willingness to  accommodate my furry friends along with me and the proximity to the customs and cargo facilities from which they were collected was a major factor in selecting this particular stopover point.

This is an excellent location for a stay the night before flying out of LAX.  The area feels safe, the space is clean and comfortable with an individual minisplit HVAC to set your exact comfort.  Great water pressure and hot water for a shower or bath.  Ceiling-mounted TV with Roku device to provide access to any streaming service you prefer.  For its intended purpose, I can't think of any way the host could improve their offering.  Thanks for another good nights' sleep before a flight home!",2023.0

1781,39471761.0,8.942554906790839e+17,2023-05-18,Our hosts were very responsive & understanding of our special needs. My husband has respiratory sensitivity so that the scent on the linens either from the laundry detergent or the possible use of an additive triggered an an adverse reaction. Our hosts were very kind and understanding. We left for dinner for 2 plus hours to give our hosts time to drop off freshly laundered set of linens & blankets but we were unable to stay as the scent had permeated the apartment. The apartment was beautiful & well appointed. We were disappointed to have to check out that evening.,2023.0
