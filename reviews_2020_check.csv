As they approached the door, they moved the knob (as if they were trying to come in) and walked away as soon as they heard me get up. Once I get up to try and see who it was, they were gone but out of curiosity, I check to see if the sliding door (leading to the porch) was locked— it wasn’t! I instantly lock it and of course my mind starts wondering if anyone was inside the place while I was gone throughout the day, or if anyone was going to come in while I was sleeping (if I didn’t check the sliding door and it was left unlocked). However, I didn’t let this incident alter my decision to stay the night and didn’t alert the host. <br/>Next morning comes around and around 11am, the cleaning lady comes to knock on the door to see if I’ve checked out yet. However, she didn’t need to come just yet cause not only is checkout at noon; there is a button you push next to the front door to alert the cleaning lady to come once you leave. <br/>Approximately 30 minutes pass by (still isn’t check out time), and the same lady keys the code into the door and walks into the place WHILE I AM NAKED, preparing to take a quick shower prior to leaving. She did not knock at all and again, CHECK OUT WAS AT NOON! I instantly start yelling cause this is the THIRD TIME in less than 24 hours that someone has come to the door for NO REASON. I immediately alert the host of the situation and he instantly replies, urging to call him on the phone. I call him on the phone once I’m out the shower and after speaking about the situation, there was no resolution. He didn’t offer any form of refund or anything for the consistent inconvenience; only tried to reassure me that if I ever chose to stay there again, these incidences wouldn’t happen. <br/>On that note, though this is a nice place... to the point I wanted to stay an additional night; after the consistent issues, I will not be staying at this location due to the lack of safety, hospitality, and communication.",2020.0

The colors and feel are neutral like a hotel, but the location is quiet and comfortable like a tucked away studio apartment. Parking was easy the night we arrived (on Sunday) and having a ‘staycation’ night in the city here was lovely. The temp had dropped after we took a walk around the neighborhood and being able to turn in the heat when came back was great. In less than 3 minutes, we were all warmed up from the wall mounted appliance. We were also looking for a place that was dog friendly for the sweetest 40ish lb tree walker coonhound we have. She was comfortable too. Curled right up for a night’s sleep below the bed on her doggy blankets. The bathroom was clean, the mattress and bed slept well, the tv is huge and if you’re into catching half a cooking show like we did, you won’t need any other lights on as it lights the entire room. The neighbors were friendly. Walking our dog, we shared courtesy “hello’s” with everyone we passed that night and the next morning. Checkout service was smooth as well. We even had time to dance and sit outside in the mini courtyard before taking off. We had a wonderful experience and would book it again in a heartbeat.",2021.0

If you don’t mind driving a little this is the best location, quiet and clean, in a safe residential neighborhood with plenty of parking. I stayed for 3 nights, it went smoothly. The bed was very comfortable, the host provides a keurig coffee machine for your coffee needs, which was great. There’s an air conditioner if it gets too hot.

The gate locked us out & stopped working once we entered so it had to be left propped open. Upon entering the room, there was rain water that had leaked in through the main door so I immediately messaged the host about it, especially due to their added rule on keeping the carpet clean. The sliding doors & the restroom were both open/unlocked when we arrived which caused me to feel a bit unsafe. No lotion was available. The room was extremely humid & I sweat through the night as a result. The biggest concern was that at almost 11pm, there was metal clanging & dragging, stomping, & loud talking behind & right above our heads (from where the bed was located).

They communicated early and always responded promptly and upon arrival gave us a good overview of the place but without overloading us with to much info because there was a nice house guide that laid out everything that you needed to know about the house. <br/>The casita itself is as close to perfection as you could imagine. Has all the essentials, laid out well so nothing feels cluttered, and has a thoughtful design and aesthetic. And then there’s the lovely outdoor area which is a little oasis, complete with a fountain, nice chairs and a beautiful garden. <br/>Can’t recommend Jeff and Shelley enough, their casita is the epitome of why AirBnB works so well, the joy of staying with strangers who make you feel perfectly at home :)",2020.0

I’m sure LAX is even faster. Place is easy to access with plenty of street parking. Place looks just like pictures and is very clean and updated. Better than a hotel for many reasons: no going into elevator and parking/valeting/paying; have kitchen, sitting area, and washer and dryer; feels secluded; has a cute outdoor patio with bbq; feels like a little oasis; free bottle of wine and didn’t have an astronomical hotel price tag.

This AirBnB really has everything we were looking for, and we barely left because we felt so at home and 100% content. Their spot sets the bar high. Jeff and Shelley were amazing hosts- they struck the perfect balance of letting us know that they were available for any request/question, but we also felt like we had the utmost privacy.

Jeff and Shelley were very helpful with the arrangements as it was my first time using Airbnb, and there were snags at first.<br/>My stay was very relaxing. I spent most of my time hanging outside enjoying the garden full of butterflies and other visitors (bring bug repellent if you want to hang out in the patio at night). <br/>Getting in and out was very easy and felt private. The amenities were great and the place is well designed. A full kitchen for real with all of the things you need to cook if you choose to.  <br/>I loved my stay there and will go back.<br/>Jeff and Shelley were outstanding hosts.

There are also comfortable, lovely outdoor spaces where you can relax.  The location in West LA is great - it was a quick drive to Westwood/UCLA.  I didn't head to other places in West LA on this trip, but it would be quick to get to Santa Monica and other beach locations.

1146,23395506,651479506038138100,2022-06-17,60366502,Kevin,"The place is a wonderful little space and the bed is comfortable. There are two indoor wall-mounted A/C units. The casita will get stuffy if you don't open the windows. The dishwasher works very well. The bathroom is very nice. The TV set up has Youtube TV and is great to use.<br/>The only issue I had is a received a TON of mosquito bites during my stay. Jeff accommodated me by helping me install a mosquito net that I purchased, which helped a lot. I still got bit while hanging around the casita though. The other thing I noticed was that there are a ton of spiders in the unit, which I didn't mind, but might bother some people.<br/>The other thing I will say is Jeff and Shelley are nice people for the most part. But when I was dealing with numerous bites (and it was bad, I had to go see a doctor who suspected fleas or bed bugs, though it turned out to just be mosquitoes) they were extremely defensive and condescending. Their tone completely changed from ""warm host"" to people that only cared about making sure they got paid. They didn't care about my condition at all and didn't speak to me in a friendly manner.<br/>I did need to extend my stay a few days and they accommodated that, which I appreciated. They also worked with me to return a couple items I had left behind.<br/>Overall, would've been an excellent place to stay had it not been for the mosquitoes that found their way inside and the few negative interactions I had with Jeff and Shelley (though most were positive). Because I think reviews should depend on price, and because this property was over $4k/month and I don't think the price reflected that, 3 stars.",2022.0

The location is actually on the main road, so once you are backing from the parking place, you are on a main road with high traffic, so really need to watch out. 2. The apartment only has a 2nd floor, so the minute you open the door, you have to drag the luggage case across long stair steps, which is kind of inconvenient. The place does not have a kitchen and only a coffee machine, so drinking water become a little bit difficult.

But beware, the water for the shower wasn’t hot at all. I actually a bit upset by this, but the owner didn’t charge me for checking out late, so I didn’t wanna complain, but that’s something they need to work on and improve. I would also strongly suggest they fix the jacuzzi, which was advertised, but didn’t work at all. I actually wanted a credit for a future stay or discount or a portion of my money returned for these two issues. I would say, other than this, the apt/condo is very nice and spacious too!! <br/>I did enjoy staying there but the bed could also use an upgrade, the mattress is not that soft and could be replaced!! Again, the location is ideal for someone staying close to the airport, it’s also not bad for a weekend stay, and has ample space for a couple or getaway trip!! <br/>I would rate the unit 3 out of 5!!",2022.0

I can see the entrance check-in being a little tricky but because Grant was so communicative, check in was a breeze. There are a set of stairs to climb so be aware if you’re hauling suitcases (not too steep). <br/>Only thing is that walls aren’t soundproof, we could hear our neighbors with music past 11pm. <br/>Other than that, highly recommend this comfortable and safe spot.",2023.0

1753,39471761,858753616029017048,2023-03-30,149124393,Brittany,Grant’s place was so cozy!  A perfect location to get to Manhattan Beach or drive into the city in Los Angeles.  The amenities were perfect and both Grant and Tianna were amazing hosts!  Grant even checked on us after our first night to ensure everything was great.  Tianna followed up with me after check-out with some additional travel inquires in such a prompt manner.  Both hosts exuded an exceptional client experience so will definitely be staying with them any time that we are in California (if they have the availability).,2023.0

Great water pressure and hot water for a shower or bath.  Ceiling-mounted TV with Roku device to provide access to any streaming service you prefer.

My husband has respiratory sensitivity so that the scent on the linens either from the laundry detergent or the possible use of an additive triggered an an adverse reaction. Our hosts were very kind and understanding. We left for dinner for 2 plus hours to give our hosts time to drop off freshly laundered set of linens & blankets but we were unable to stay as the scent had permeated the apartment. The apartment was beautiful & well appointed. We were disappointed to have to check out that evening.,2023.0
