highly recommend to everyone plus it closely located to the airport. this was our second time booking this space because its great. easy access to the airport, safe neighborhood, great amenities, large space for suitcases. great value in a convenient location, especially if you are flying. isaac was quick to reply and the unit was immaculately clean. i loved it will be returning soon. first and foremost, i want to start by saying that this place is beautiful and the positive reviews is what initially lured me into booking, but there were a few issues that occurred. to start, i was laying down watching tv around 11 pm and hear someone approach the door. as they approached the door, they moved the knob as if they were trying to come in and walked away as soon as they heard me get up. once i get up to try and see who it was, they were gone but out of curiosity, i check to see if the sliding door leading to the porch was locked it was not! i instantly lock it and of course my mind starts wondering if anyone was inside the place while i was gone throughout the day, or if anyone was going to come in while i was sleeping if i did not check the sliding door and it was left unlocked. however, i did not let this incident alter my decision to stay the night and did not alert the host. next morning comes around and around 11am, the cleaning lady comes to knock on the door to see if i have checked out yet. however, she did not need to come just yet cause not only is checkout at noon; there is a button you push next to the front door to alert the cleaning lady to come once you leave. approximately 30 minutes pass by still is not check out time, and the same lady keys the code into the door and walks into the place while i am naked, preparing to take a quick shower prior to leaving. she did not knock at all and again, check out was at noon! i instantly start yelling cause this is the third time in less than 24 hours that someone has come to the door for no reason. i immediately alert the host of the situation and he instantly replies, urging to call him on the phone. i call him on the phone once i am out the shower and after speaking about the situation, there was no resolution. he did not offer any form of refund or anything for the consistent inconvenience; only tried to reassure me that if i ever chose to stay there again, these incidences would not happen. on that note, though this is a nice place. to the point i wanted to stay an additional night; after the consistent issues, i will not be staying at this location due to the lack of safety, hospitality, and communication. 2nd time staying here and it was just as cool as last time, easy check in my only complaint is that parking was a bit difficult to find but should be expected when there is a pandemic and everyone is home. great stay i only wish i booked this place originally. great location, near airport beach car rentals dispensaries, what else can u ask for. would be nice if they added a hot tub just a thought. but great value. fast responses was the best when short on time. loved staying here! great price, very clean, communicative host. thank you so much for the drinks in the fridge, they were much needed! would definitely stay again! nice location and clean close to the airport mcdonald, seven eleven. i loved the space. thanks forletting me stay. assume host beautiful private guest home. very friendly owner, would definitely stay again! the guest suite was as described. no surprisesdisappointments upon arrival. the guest suite is situated on a deadend street but no shortage of street parking. proximity to lax is literally 5mins away but never heard any fly over traffic noise during my stay while the windows were closed, of course. id definitely stay here again on my next early flight out of lax. second time staying here. i absolutely love it. always pristinely clean, lovely refreshments, easy checkin. host is flexible and very friendly. will stay here any chance i get. awesome stay super close to the airport. perfect for one or two people. stocked with water, drinks, tea and coffee and everything else i needed! great place to stay near lax. very clean and well decorated. everything is modern and up to date. easy also to access separate outdoor entrance on the ground floor. 5 min away from the airport, 20 min from the center. good place for 12 people, clean, convenient. very clean and good value. i stayed here two nights and it was pretty close to perfect because it was so close to lax. the space was super cozy and it in a quiet neighborhood. the host was helpful. i wish it had a kitchen, but no kitchen is advertised anyway, so it ok. isaac was very nice to provide drinks in the fridge and a coffee maker. would recommend. this place is definitely one i would stay at again! the suite was amazingly clean very important during these covidtimes! and the location could not have been better. we stayed there between two flights at lax and it was only 10 minutes away. the amenities provided were wonderful i really appreciate having a fridge and coffee available and the bed could not have been more comfortable or warm. thanks again! great place to stay and very peaceful  love the location  and omg the bed was so comfortable. we had a great stay at issacs. super clean and so close to lax. would definitely recommend! definitely booking again! the place needs to be aired out. i did not like the smell and had to keep the screen window open for hours. the bed is breaking and i almost fell sitting on the bottom edge of it. the neighbors upstairs got super loud and obnoxious at 630a disturbing my sleep. the checkout is 12p, but it feels rushed with the noise that seems intentional. everything else was very modern and clean. he provided water, tea, and coffee complimentary. the water helped the headache from the early wake up. this is a very nice, clean unit. checkin was easy and it had all the amenities we needed. location is great and isaac was very helpful. great location nice neighborhood isaac is a great host felt like my home away from home. short but pleasant stay at isaacs. check in was easy, was able to find street parking close by on a monday night in a neighborhood that felt safe. as previous reviews mentioned, it is easy to hear the upstairs neighbors and the noise did wake us up in the morning but it did not bother us so much! perfect for 12 people. easily accessible with the access code! very clean and cozy environment. will definitely come back! very beautiful home, so relaxing and very clean. stayed for just one day since i had a flight to catch but even for one day it was a great stay. what can i say? better than the pictures and very easy check in as well as a button for you to click once checking out to let them know once we are out ofc so they can come professionally clean the room! a. for a quick two days, this place is nice to stay and a quick 12 minute drive from lax. i spent most of my time inside the room doing work and it was a nice clean quite space to complete it. great little spot. comparable to a hotel suite. exactly what i needed. this lil cottage get away  was beautiful. everything was great! perfect location near the airport in a quiet and safe neighborhood. the place was very clean and the water and coffee were perfect! amazing place. very relaxing and close to the airport. the bathroom and huge tv were amongst my favorite. but the coffee corner makes it the best about this suit. i will definitely try and book it again. isaac place was perfect for a quiet stay, it very nice and clean, like a nice hotel room but with a private entrance and he even had some refreshments for us. it has a desk to work from. just 1010. and isaac was gracious and very quick in communication. totally recommend. absolutely phenomenal!

very clean, nice place to stay. it was perfect for our 24 hour trip since we just needed a place to sleep. the bed was the comfiest we have had in a air bnb, towels were nice and plush and linen also smelled very clean. the only downside if you have kids or really need a restful nights sleep you might not be able to sleep because we could hear everytime someone upstairs walked around and heard them talking loudly until about 1: 30 am. if you can put the noise aside it is a perfect place to lay your head at night. the place was clean as a whistle. the refrigerator was stocked with clean drinking water. all necessary check in directions were sent promptly and clear. issac is a super host. needed a one night stay after a cancelled flight and this place was perfect!

checkin and checkout process was smooth and easy. close to sofi stadium and lax. convenient and nice. it is a great apartment, the only two inconvenience items are following: 1. the location is actually on the main road, so once you are backing from the parking place, you are on a main road with high traffic, so really need to watch out. 2. the apartment only has a 2nd floor, so the minute you open the door, you have to drag the luggage case across long stair steps, which is kind of inconvenient. the place does not have a kitchen and only a coffee machine, so drinking water become a little bit difficult. and also it does not have central ac, so it will take a while for the unit to warm up. communicated everything well, enjoyed the location, and was as expected! very cozy, great area. everything pictured is accurate, would definitely return in the future. this listing is conveniently close to the highway. grant was really responsive and accommodating. the fenced off mini patio area near the entrance with fake grass was such a good touch, especially because i traveled with a puppy. would recommend and come back again. easy access and very up to date in cleanliness. grant was communicable and helpful to our needs. the complimentary coffee and tea and bathroom amenities were also very nice. it was a nice place and it was really cozy. definitely would want to stay here again: the location of this stay is great and right by the airport!

me and my husband booked this place with grant for our honeymoon and the location is near the airport which is super convenient, clean room with a huge restroom bathtub included is a plus. also, i love the complementary coffee, highly recommended; room is private and secluded from the rest of the house. lots of space to move around and sit comfortably in different parts of the room. being pet friendly made this an easy decision for us as we were traveling with our dog. room is on the second floor so be sure your pet is comfortable with stairs. coffee maker and small fridge were nice features. no kitchen available, so do not expect to be able to cook food. large tv with streaming services helped us pass the time in the evening. we were given a parking spot in the driveway which made loading and unloading the car easy. neighborhood felt very safe and has easy freeway access. grants place was just as advertised in the pictures. check in was very easy. i will definitely book again with grant thanks. everything as described. it was actually even better, since in the pictures there was not a dining table that was present during my stay. comfy bed and the bathroom amenities were great. would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again!

i stayed here to break up the travel between driving my cat to lax and the time he would spend in the kennel on the plane. this place is 5 minutes from the drop off location; great spot. there is traffic noise but quieter than i expected. its across from a school and feels relatively safe. usually when traveling with a cat you do not have a lot of options, most are dirty and run down extended stay motels. for less, i got a large, clean place with a huge bathroom and parking right out front. they even accommodated my late check out at no charge. i had trouble getting the door open and the host messaged me back in minutes. 1010, would stay here again. wonderful room. spacious bathroom. clean. close to airport. this was a fantastic stay!

a clean, perfect, thoughtful stay starts and ends with chilled water, extra toothbrushes, netflix, hulu, and so much more. thoroughly enjoyed. the space was as advertised and clean. the airbnb was amazing. a perfect location to see all of los angeles. grant has an amazing communication. this was my 2nd visit and looking forward to the next visit. great place to get a good  nights sleep after a busy vacation and before our early morning flight. place was spotless, easy to check in with keypads, close to lax and rental car return. this listing is exactly as listed. we booked this for the ram game and the location was great. super close to both lax and sofi and only 25 min from the beach. would definitely stay again! great hosts and great place! ! grant was a great host, anything we needed he was able to provide, i plan on staying here my next trip! thank you  relaxing stay and great location. many great pros: nice neighborhoodclose to laxprivate studiosoft carpetgreat lightinggreat spacious bathroomfridge stocked with beveragestowels providedsoft bedlarge tv ability to control heator cool the room. very cleareasy selfcheckin and easy checkoutcons: the towels and fuzzy blanket there was one hiding in the closet that i am not sure i was even supposed to accessing; maybe it was an unwashed blanket and thus was put away in the closet could have been cleaner they had a smell. but this is an easily addressable issue i do not suspect this will be an issues going forward. the host was responsive and flexible. the instructions were clear, the access was easy. the appartment is spacious, clean, really nice. although there has been air and road traffic as well in the neighborhood, there was not much noise during the night; not more than you would experience in any major city. lovely place, would def come back again. very spacious and comfy bed. great location close to lax nice comfy stay. very nice and private place! you do have to share parking on the driveway with some other people who are staying at the home i am assuming but we had a different private entrance and own space which i loved. very clean and welcoming. grant always communicated when something was needed. area is nice as well. would stay again! thank you grant! the place was clean and spacious, and the host was very responsive. great location to lax. the only thing is the bed was not the most comfortable and it felt like i was sinking into the springs of it. easy to find and close to the airport. there was some minor traffic noise but not much and the biuilding was rather quiet, peaceful. the appartment was spacious and clean. close to lax and large space with all necessities. grant was a great host, from time of booking, checking incheckout time the communication was on top. the master suite was fully stocked with all necessities and the place was clean. what you see is really what you get!

1010  very cozy! great area not much noise at all. everything you need  thanks guys for the smooth business. stay was amazing! quick and easy check in. extremely clean and comfy. the pictures definitely did not do enough justice. great balcony view as well as communication about what i needed for my stay. super peaceful and quiet perfect for a little getaway! would definitely come back. great location, plenty of space, easy checkin. super easy for a walk in the beach and an earlier departure at lax. the condo space was very well located for those who need to be close to the airport. but beware, the water for the shower was not hot at all. i actually a bit upset by this, but the owner did not charge me for checking out late, so i did not wanna complain, but that something they need to work on and improve. i would also strongly suggest they fix the jacuzzi, which was advertised, but did not work at all. i actually wanted a credit for a future stay or discount or a portion of my money returned for these two issues. i would say, other than this, the aptcondo is very nice and spacious too. i did enjoy staying there but the bed could also use an upgrade, the mattress is not that soft and could be replaced. again, the location is ideal for someone staying close to the airport, it also not bad for a weekend stay, and has ample space for a couple or getaway trip. i would rate the unit 3 out of 5! ! grant and tianna are great hosts! they made us feel welcomed and respond quickly. the location is perfect and not in a busy area but close enough to the forum or sofi. this was an excellent place to stay. location is super convenient if you are flying in or out of lax. checkin was easy and the hosts communicated very well. we had a very quiet and enjoyable stay. would use this place again. grant was great. house was very clean and cozy. would definitely stay here again. was concerned about the noise with the location, but it was not noisy at all. awesome stay!
